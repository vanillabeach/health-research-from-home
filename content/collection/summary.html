    Many patients and the public are willing, and often keen, to contribute to health research. This is
    especially true if the research addresses questions of personal importance, and which lead to clear
    public benefit. Unfortunately, taking part in research is not always easy with practical challenges like
    needing to travel for clinic visits during a working week.
  </p>
  <p>
    Smartphones and wearables provide a new opportunity for patients and the public to contribute to
    health research from the comfort of their home. For patients, this can make participation easier and
    allows more people to take part. For researchers, it provides an exciting source of new data,
    allowing important questions to be addressed that have previously been unanswerable.

    Opportunities include measuring things more frequently: for example logging daily symptoms during
    the pandemic via the Zoe COVID Symptom Study smartphone app allowed us to understand that loss
    of smell was an important and specific symptom of COVID-19 infection. Consumer technology also
    allows researchers to measure things more accurately. This might include using sensors within your
    smartphone or wrist-worn device to measure how your activity is changing in response to your
    disease, or perhaps following a new treatment. This new type of data that comes direct from the
    public can be even more useful if combined with other data, such as information provided by clinical
    teams within health records, or genetic blood samples that have been donated for research.
    The number of successful health research studies using smartphones and wearables, however,
    remains low. This is because it is new and difficult. It requires research teams to overcome lots of
    barriers simultaneously.
    For example, they need to design the study so patients will be interested,
    can take part simply and easily and will remain engaged through time. They need to find the right
    technology partner to help them understand what can be measured with the device, and how to do
    that in the best possible way. They need to ensure all the data remains secure as it moves from the
    device to computer storage ready for analysis. They need to understand how best to analyse and
    interpret this new continuous stream of data.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our Partnership Grant is bringing together researchers who have all conducted successful studies
    using smartphones and wearables. It is our intention to pool our experience and share it with the
    wider research community. We will do this by running a series of events. These will describe studies
    that have gone well, as well as those that haven't, to share lessons learned. We will host regular
    online meetings and annual events that will allow the whole community to meet and learn from one
    another. We will host 'walk-in' clinics providing advice and support about partnership with patients
    and the public, and how best to conduct research safely and securely. We will support researchers to
    develop strong bids for future research, and will run annual challenges to improve the way in which
    we can analyse those continuous data streams. We will share all of this learning at the events, and
    will also store it online (eg as documents or short videos) for anyone to access any time.
  </p>

    We will also run two projects at the cutting edge of Health Research from Home which require data
    from smartphones and wearables to be linked to other health data: one on understanding patterns
    of physical activity after knee replacements, and the second on long-term health outcomes of Long
    COVID. The projects will answer clinically important questions and simultaneously enhance our
    understanding of how best to conduct such studies.
  </p>
  <p>
    Taken together, we aim to establish new partnerships, build capacity in this important area and
    advance into new, technically difficult areas. We will develop a skilled and sustainable community
    who will, in the future, be enable the public to help answer many of those questions that matter to
    them through the use of their own devices.
