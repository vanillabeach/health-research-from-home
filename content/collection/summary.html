    Much of our understanding of the distribution, causes and consequences of disease comes from
    epidemiology or population health research. This field of science has evolved over decades, moving
    from the ‘shoe leather epidemiology’ of John Snow during the 1854 Cholera epidemic, to population
    surveys, to cohort studies and registers, and to ‘real world data’ using routinely collected health
    information from administrative data and electronic health records. Much of this real-world data is
    collected by researchers or clinicians, typically at one-off assessments or at irregularly spaced visits.

  <p>
    The widespread uptake of consumer technology by patients and the public provides a new platform
    to advance our understanding of the causes and consequences of disease, creating the opportunity
    for people to contribute to health research by providing data from home. Such electronic person-
    generated health data (ePGHD) collected via smartphones and wearables will allow top priority, as-
    yet unanswered research questions to be answered, such as the examples from James Lind Alliance
    Priority Setting Partnerships (1) shown in Box 1. Specific benefits that unlock these opportunities
    include the convenience and ease of participation; the ability to share richer information about their
    disease – for example, tracking how their physical and mental health symptoms change day-to-day,
    providing objective data about their environment, their behaviour (such as physical activity) and
    performance in digital physical and mental tasks; lower costs by avoiding the need for research visit
    appointments; plus the opportunity to develop a more direct, two-way relationship with research
    participants, allowing research results to be fed back directly (ref- <a href="javascript:;">Charting a Course</a>).

  <p>
    The aim of this Partnership Grant is to bring together, strengthen and advance the interdisciplinary
    community necessary for success in conducting health research from home. We will do this by: 
    <ol>
      <li>
        collating best practice in smartphone and wearable population health research across the
        assembled partnership and spreading this to the wider community (<a href="javascript:;">WP1</a> and <a href="javascript:;">2</a>)
      </li>
      <li>
        pioneering
    the new era of using smartphone and wearable data linked to existing research databanks (WP3),
    using the assembled people, methods and technology across the new partnership.
      </li>
    </ol>
    Ultimately, this
    will allow research questions to be addressed that have been difficult to answer to date (Box 1), and
    will position the UK as a global leader in innovative, participatory population health research.
